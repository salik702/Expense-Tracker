description: Create a single dummy user in the database
agent: build
---

Read database/db.py to understand the users table
schema and the get_db() helper.

Then write and run a Python script using Bash that:

1. Generates a realistic random Pakistan user using your
   own knowledge of common Pakistani names across regions:
   - Name: a realistic Pakistani first + last name
   - Email: derived from the name with a random 2-3 digit
     number suffix (e.g. ahmed.khan42@gmail.com)
   - Password: "password123" hashed with werkzeug's
     generate_password_hash
   - created_at: current datetime

2. Checks if the generated email already exists in the
   users table. If it does, regenerate until unique.

3. Inserts the user into the database using the same
   get_db() pattern found in db.py.

4. Prints confirmation:
   - id
   - name
   - email
